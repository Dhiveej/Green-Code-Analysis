🌳 Green Code Analysis - Week 1 Project
📄 Description
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) into the field of Green Software Engineering. The goal is to understand how different Python execution methods impact energy consumption, execution time, and the overall carbon footprint. 🌍 This was completed as a requirement for the Week 1 project.

🚀 Getting Started
The complete analysis for this project is contained in the Jupyter Notebook. To view the work, please navigate to the archive folder and open the following file:

📊 Dataset
The analysis was performed on the Python Energy Microscope Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains benchmark results for 5 different Python execution methods.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python 🐍

Pandas 🐼

Jupyter Notebook 📓

💡 Key Finding
The initial exploration reveals a significant performance difference between the methods. The most energy-efficient method was found to be nearly four times more efficient than the least efficient one, highlighting the major impact that software optimization can have on energy consumption. ⚡️
